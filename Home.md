Hi there! Iâ€™m Gauthier ðŸ¤“

This blog's topic is my journey, as a former historian and a current Firmware/embedded Software Engineer, through the marvelous world of the Artificial Intelligence.
It has been a long time since I started being curious about artificial intelligence, but until very recently, I hadn't taken the step to really understand it. I only knew about it through the media, and from my use of some of their applications (for instance, the translation tool that sometimes helps me express my thoughts in English when writing this blog). 
To remedy this situation, I decided to get some real training on the subject, by enrolling in an [[Hands on AI|university certificate]] offered by the University of Mons (Belgium). I'm also reading a lot on the subject, and I plan to discuss here all the things I'll learn from this formative journey. Among other things, I'll try to give advice to those who, like me, are starting this adventure belatedly.
If you are curious, you can learn more about me [[About Me|here]].
